### Changed
 - Requires GDAL >= 2.1 if rebuilding against a system-installed GDAL library
 - (***BREAKING***) Switch the progress callback of `gdal.Driver.createCopy{Async}` from a raw argument to an argument inside an object to differentiate it from a result callback when some options are omitted in async mode
 - (***BREAKING***) `gdal.RasterBand.noDataValue` now returns `NaN` if the original value was `NaN` instead of null; when setting it to `null` it correctly clears the `NoDataValue` instead of setting it to `NaN`; one should still exercise care when using `NaN` as a `NoDataValue` - since even if the binary representation is defined by IEEE 754, different formats, compilers or architectures may exhibit different behavior
 - Fix #16, missing locking for GDAL operations involving multiple datasets when an event loop warning is emitted
 - Enable lazy-binding on macOS, meaning that Release builds on all platforms use lazy-binding now
 - `gdal.Driver.create{Async}` now throw if they fail to parse the options instead of returning `undefined`
 - `gdal.DatasetBands.create{Async}` and `gdal.SpatialReference.fromESRI` now have correct TypeScript signatures, all options lists are supported either in `{object}` or in `string[]` form
 - `gdal.checksumImage{Async}` now throw/reject on error instead of returning 0 if the GDAL method returned an error, but the GDAL method still returns 0 on some errors and does take into account fractional numbers < 1.0
 - Fix a memory leak in `gdal.Dataset.srsAsync`
 - Fix a memory leak in the exception-handling path of the progress callbacks
 - Fix #13, now two different warnings are emitted whether a dataset is closed by `gdal.Dataset.close` or it is destroyed by the GC - the former is indicative of a bug in the user application, while the latter is indicative of a bug in `gdal-async` itself
 - Correctly identify all async getters as being read-only in TypeScript
 - TypeScript signature and documentation entry for `gdal.LayerFields.fromObject`, it did not exist before
 - Correct TypeScript signatures for all `gdal.FeatureFields` iterators, they now return `any` objects instead of a `gdal.fieldValue`
 - Correct TypeScript signature for `gdal.Dataset.srs{Async}` - now it can be `null`
 - Correct TypeScript signature for `gdal.Dataset.geoTransform{Async}` - now it can be `null`
 - Correct TypeScript signatures for `gdal.RasterBand.id{Async}`, `gdal.RasterBand.minimum{Async}`, `gdal.RasterBand.maximum{Async}`, `gdal.RasterBand.offset{Async}`, `gdal.RasterBand.scale{Async}` - now they can be `null`
 - Correct TypeScript signature for `gdal.DatasetLayers.create{Async}` - `srs` and `geometry` are optional and default to `null`
 - Correct TypeScript signature for `gdal.DatasetLayers.copy{Async}`, the first argument is of type `gdal.Layer`
 - Correct TypeScript signature for `gdal.Layer.setSpatialFilter`, it now has two separate signatures, one that accepts a `gdal.Geometry|null` and another that accepts `number, number, number, number`
 - Correct TypeScript signature for `gdal.Layer.setAttributeFilter`, it now accepts `null` as argument
 - Correct TypeScript signature for `gdal.Feature.setGeometry`, it now accepts `null` as argument
 - Correct TypeScript signature for `gdal.Geometry.srs`, now it can be `null`
 - Correct TypeScript signatures for `gdal.SpatialReference.getAuthority{Code,Name}`, now they accept `null` as argument
 - Correct TypeScript signatures for `gdal.config.set` and `gdal.config.get`, now they can accept/return `null`
 - Correct numerous TypeScript signatures for callback functions to match the return type of the function
 - Do not produce persistent temporary files in the unit tests

## [3.3.4] 2021-09-28

### Added
 - Add support for Amazon Linux and restore Ubuntu 16.04 support (glibc 2.23)
 - On Linux, build GDAL with `ENABLE_UFFD` for virtual I/O support on drivers that allow it (currently only NetCDF) to allow accessing NetCDF subdatasets with remote virtual filesystems
 - Add a new npm script - `npm run prune` - not to be confused with `npm prune` - which allows to keep only the module runtime, significantly reducing the size of the installed package

### Changed
 - Fix `gdal.RasterBand.flushAsync()`
 - Implement the previously non-existing `strict` argument of `gdal.Driver.createCopy{Async}()` and move it after `options`
 - Implement progress callbacks in `gdal.Driver.createCopy{Async}()`
 - `gdal.Driver.createCopy{Async}()` now always throws an `Error` / rejects the Promise if the operation failed instead of returning a null object in some cases
 - Fix #14, correctly handle exceptions in progress callbacks and return them to the calling user code
 - Add a previously missing TypeScript signature for `gdal.CoordinateTransformation.transformPoint(point: xyz)`
 - Fix the documentation / TypeScript signature for `gdal.Geometry.segmentize` - it returns `undefined`
 - Removed all source tarballs of the bundled dependencies from the published package to reduce its size

 - Add `gdal.Geometry.makeValid{Async}()`

### Changed
 - Correctly measure the wall time for the event loop warnings
 - Fix a number of memory leaks in `gdal.SpatialReference.clone()`, `gdal.SpatialReference.cloneGeogCS()` and when constructing a `gdal.SpatialReference` with a `wkt` argument
 - Remove a wasteful reallocation in `gdal.Dataset.root`

## [3.3.1] 2021-06-17

### Changed
 - `gdal.DatasetLayers.get{Async}()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid layer is requested instead of returning a null object
 - `gdal.FeatureDefnFields.get{Async}()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid field definition is requested instead of returning a null object
 - `gdal.FeatureFields.get{Async}()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid field is requested instead of returning a null object
    - it can still return `null` if the field exists in the definition but it is not set in the feature
 - `gdal.GDALDrivers.get()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid driver is requested instead of returning a null object
 - `gdal.GeometryCollectionChildren.get()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid sub-geometry is requested instead of returning a null object

 - `gdal.LineStringPoints.get()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid point is requested instead of returning a null object
 - `gdal.PolygonRings.get()` now throws an `Error` if an invalid ring is requested instead of returning a null object
 - All `gdal.Geometry` methods that return a `gdal.Geometry` throw an `Error` on error instead of returning a null object
 - Fix #6, a case of sleeping in the GC while destroying the sibling of an object with an active asynchronous operation
 - Fix a potential race condition in the object store
 - Fix several potential race conditions in `gdal.RasterBand`
 - Correctly throw an `Error` with an empty message if a GDAL method fails without setting the error message instead of the last previously encountered error
